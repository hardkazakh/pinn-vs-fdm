## :mountain: Overview

This study conducts a comparative analysis of the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), focusing on their respective advantages, limitations, and suitability for different problem scenarios. The error analysis, measured using the L2 relative error, indicates that FDM demonstrates superior accuracy for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional Poisson equations, with relative errors of 7.26 Ã— 10-8 and 2.21 Ã— 10-4, in contrast to PINNs, which present errors of 5.63 Ã— 10-6 and 6.01 Ã— 10-3. Furthermore, the PINN framework is utilized for forward-inverse problems, illustrating its potential to predict source terms following comprehensive training. The visualization of solutions underscores the differing methodologies of FDM and PINNs, offering valuable insights into their effectiveness and practical applications.
